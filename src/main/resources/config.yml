# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# - Use the '&' symbol for color codes (e.g., &a for green, &l for bold).
# - YAML is sensitive to spacing. Do not use tabs; use spaces.
#   Indentation is crucial for the structure.

# Default interval in SECONDS between each announcement for a server.
# For example, if a player is on the Survival server, they will see a
# new message from their announcement cycle every 60 seconds.
interval: 60

# The prefix that appears before every line of an announcement.
# Set to "" (empty quotes) to disable the prefix entirely.
prefix: "&e[&l!&r&e] &r"

#                     ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION
# ===================================================================
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# This plugin uses an intelligent, independent cycle system for each server.
#
# 1.  A server with its own specific messages (e.g., 'survival') will create a
#     unique cycle: (Global Message -> Specific Survival Msg 1 -> Specific Survival Msg 2 -> Global Message -> ...)
#
# 2.  A server WITHOUT specific messages (e.g., 'lobby') will only cycle
#     through the global messages: (Global Message 1 -> Global Message 2 -> Global Message 1 -> ...)
#
# Each server's cycle runs independently and does not affect the others.
#
announcements:
  # --- GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will be part of the cycle for EVERY server.
  # To make a message global, add "all" to its 'servers' list.

  - servers:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&eDon't forget to vote for our server every day!"
      - "&fUse the command &b/vote&f to get rewards."

  - servers:
      - "all"
    lines:
      - "&dCheck out our webstore for exclusive ranks and items!"

  # --- SERVER-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ---
  # These messages will ONLY be shown to players on the specified servers.
  # They will be inserted into the cycle after a global message.
